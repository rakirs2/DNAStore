# Bio Library

This is a generic library for biological analysis. 
Currently, it hosts analysis of Sequence data. 

There are 4 main classes which define the functionality of this library:

1. Sequence
2. DnaSequence
3. RnaSequence
4. ProteinSequence

These can be generated and get a nontrivial amount of analysis out of the box.
There are future plans for adding Synteny analysis as well as deeper integrations
with existing tooling.

As a point of reality, this was created mostly for fun/academic purposes.
Most of this analysis exists in other forms in other places. And no one, for the most part, uses C# in academia. It's all R or Python.
Additionally, academia is almost solely a linux/mac first environment.
