# DNAStore

This project is a long, long overdue idea I've had. Effectively, I hope/believe that DNA can be broken down and analzyed hierarchically.

The theory here is that a more powerful machine can then come through a corpus of this data and analyze either the summary of a given set of underlying data or go deeper into the raw data-- whether it be protein expression or the DNA/RNA sequence underneath.

The long term goal here is to take a human genome (say 1 gb of data) or a large protein/Sequence and break it down into multiple smaller files that the "Agent" can access as it sees fit.


TODOS:
- [ ] Hyper optimistic CRISPR
- [ ] Visualizer
 
Done:
- [x] Count Nucleotides
- [x] DNA to RNA conversion
- [x] Complement a strand of DNA
