# DNAStore

This project is a long, long overdue idea I've had. Effectively, It's my current understanding of analysis methods for
biological sequences

I don't really know too much about the space so I'm using this as a repository of my current knowledge/implementations--
Going through Rosalind.info problems and [BioInformatics Algorithms](https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/). Let's
see where I end up.

The theory here is that a more powerful machine can then come through a corpus of this data and analyze either the
summary of a given set of underlying data or go deeper into the raw data-- whether it be protein expression or the
DNA/RNA sequence underneath.
